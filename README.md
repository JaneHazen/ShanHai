# ShanHai

In Ancient China there was a book called the Shanhai (The Classic of Mountains and Seas) that created a map of the world, but included mythological beasts and creatures. It combined reality and legend to create the view of the world at the time. 

I used this name to author my own map. If you click on any of the countries, logged in users can add to the list of their favorite books by authors from that country, creating a world map of literature. Later, I hope to also add functionality where if users have read a book from a country, that country will appear in color.

Other people might use scratch-off maps to show the countries they have explored on foot, but with this app you can highlight the countries whose literature you have explored.
